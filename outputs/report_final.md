# Technical Report — Recycled Polymer Blend Optimization

## Objective
Develop a computational and data-driven workflow to support material selection,
simulation, experimental analysis, and sustainability assessment of recycled
polymer blends.

## Methodology
- Generation of fictitious experimental and simulated datasets
- Simplified mechanical and thermal modeling
- Integration of simulation and experimental data
- Statistical analysis and regression for model evaluation
- Design of Experiments (DoE) for test reduction
- Techno-environmental comparison of recycling routes

## Key Results
- Good agreement between simulated and experimental strength values
- RMSE used to quantify model accuracy
- DoE reduced experimental space from dozens of tests to 16 key scenarios
- Mechanical recycling with compatibilizer showed best balance between
  performance and sustainability

## Conclusions
The proposed workflow demonstrates how computational modeling and data analysis
can reduce experimental effort, support decision-making, and improve sustainability
assessment in polymer recycling processes.

## Next Steps
- Experimental validation of top-ranked formulations
- Refinement of simulation models
- Expansion to life cycle assessment (LCA)
